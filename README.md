# Truck Load Prediction

This project aims to estimate the weight that a truck can carry by considering parameters such as truck dimensions, tire air pressure, and engine capability. It provides a prediction model that can assist in determining the maximum load capacity of a truck.

## Features

- Predicts the weight capacity of a truck based on input parameters.
- Considers parameters such as truck dimensions, tire air pressure, and engine capability.
- Provides an approximation of the maximum load capacity of the truck.


### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.0)
- NumPy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Sklearn
